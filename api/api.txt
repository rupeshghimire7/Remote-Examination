*Things that are needed to learn API are:*

1. EndPoints (response = requests.get(endpoint_url_1))
2. API views.py -> JsonResponse
3. Echo 'GET Data' -> data = byteString of JsonData -> json.loads(data)
    to know the type of headers, you have various ways say headers, bodies request.META etc
4. Model instance as API response
5. model_to_dict -> (sort of serialization)


Rest Framework 
1. View and Response 
2. Model serializer
3. Injest data with DRF views (post method to send data)
